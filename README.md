It is an implementation of a DNS resolution tool similar to dig.
I have implemented it based on the DNS protocol specified in [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035).

It is by no means complete and is purely made for fun.

Before starting the implementation, I skimmed over [this](https://github.com/EmilHernvall/dnsguide/tree/master) guide.
Although the original RFC is very readable in understanding the protocol, I recommend going quickly over the guide if you have time.
